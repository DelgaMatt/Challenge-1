# <horiseon-code-refactor>

## Description

This project is a refactoring for the horiseon website. The purpose of the refactoring is to make the code more accessible, efficiant, and improved Search Engine Optimizations. No modifications altered the display of the webpage. I learned how to track corresponding elements and classes between html and css files.
